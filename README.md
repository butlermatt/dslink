DSLink
------

This version of the DSLink SDK for Go is an update from the previous version (found here: 
[sdk-dslink-go](github.com/butlermatt/sdk-dslink-go)). Once completed, the old repository
will be removed, as it was originally intended as an experiment and proof of concept. This
version will be more modular and will have better error handling.
